In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.
Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet.</pre>

<h1>HTML DOCUMENTS</h1>
<pre>
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: "!DOCTYPE html".

The HTML document itself begins with "html" and ends with "/html".
    
]The visible part of the HTML document is between "body" and "/body"
</pre>
<h2>The " !DOCTYPE " Declaration</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The " !DOCTYPE " declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.</li>
    <li>It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).</li>
    <li>The " !DOCTYPE " declaration is not case sensitive.</li>
</ol>
<h2>HTML Headings</h2>
<ul>
    <li>HTML headings are defined with the " h1 " to " h6 " tags<li>
    <li> " h1 " defines the most important heading. " h6 " defines the least important heading:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
example:-- "h1" "/h1"<br>
           "h2" "/h2"<br>
           "h3" "/h3"<br>
           "h4" "/h4"<br>
           "h5" "/h5"<br>          
           "h6" "/h6"<br>
</pre> 
<h2>HTML Paragraph</h2>
Html Paragraph is define as a " p ".

<h2>HTML Link</h2>

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
<pre>
The link's destination is specified in the <mark>href</mark> attribute. 

Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.
    
You will learn more about attributes in a later chapter.
      
</pre>
<h2>HTML Image</h2>

<h4>View HTML Source Code</h4>

or similar in other browsers. This will open a window containing the HTML source code of the page.
